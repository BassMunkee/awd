Maya AWD v1.0.0

This is an AWD2 exporter for Autodesk Maya. To install, copy the contents of
the enclosed scripts folder to your Maya scripts folder, and the contents of
the enclosed plug-ins folder to your Maya plug-ins folder. 

Maya can be (and is by default) configured to look in several places for 
scripts and plug-ins. Examples of such locations are:

Mac OS X: /Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya

Once you've placed the scripts and plug-ins contents in their appropriate
locations on your hard drive, launch Maya and look in the Plug-in manager
(Window > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in manager.) You should be able to find
the MayaAWDExporter.py file there. Check the "Loaded" checkbox, and optionally
the "Auto-load" one as well to avoid having to redo this procedure.

The AWD2 file format should now appear in your export dialogs.
